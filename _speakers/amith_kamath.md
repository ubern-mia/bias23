Amith is a doctoral student with Prof. Mauricio Reyes in the MIA lab, at the ARTORG Center, aiming to learn more about Image Segmentation and itsâ€™ robustness in clinical settings. Earlier, he learnt vision and robotics at Georgia Tech, and wrote a masters' thesis focusing on reducing MRI acquisition times while maintaining accurate orientation measurement of white matter fibers in our brains at the University of Minnesota.

In another life, he was a software developer for image/vision at the MathWorks Inc., built content for undergraduate courses, ran interactive workshops/seminars, all in the broad areas intersecting computer science, biomedical engineering, and mathematics.
