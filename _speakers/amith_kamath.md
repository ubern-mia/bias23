Amith is a doctoral student with Prof. Mauricio Reyes in the MIA lab, at the ARTORG Center, aiming to learn more about Image Segmentation and its’ robustness in clinical settings. Earlier, he learnt vision and robotics at Georgia Tech, and wrote a masters' thesis focusing on reducing MRI acquisition times while maintaining accurate orientation measurement of white matter fibers in our brains at the University of Minnesota.

In another life, he was a software developer for image/vision at the MathWorks Inc., built content for undergraduate courses, ran interactive workshops/seminars, all in the broad areas intersecting computer science, biomedical engineering, and mathematics.
