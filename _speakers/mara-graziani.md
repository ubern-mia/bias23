Mara Graziani is a postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research Zurich and at two applied universities in Switzerland: ZHAW and HES-SO Valais. She obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Geneva in December 2021. Her research aims at using interpretable deep learning methods to support and facilitate knowledge discovery in bio-medical research. During her Ph.D., she was a visiting student at the Martinos Center, part of the Harvard Medical School in Boston (MA) to focus on the interaction between clinicians and deep learning systems.
Coming from a background of IT Engineering, she was awarded the Engineering Department Award for completing the M.Phil. in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at the University of Cambridge (UK) in 2017.
