Dr. Suter's main research area is the application of machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics to study Glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive brain tumor. He has previously leverage longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Inselspital and public data sources to explore patterns for treatment response assessment. Other topics of interest include the robustness of radiomic features on MRI to changes in image acquisition parameters and multi-center studies, and the integration of non-imaging information and prior clinical knowledge.
