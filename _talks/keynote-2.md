Despite growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical imaging, there are still barriers to widespread adoption. One key issue is the lack of tools to monitor model performance over time, which is important because model performance can degrade in various scenarios. This talk will propose a system to address this issue, which relies on statistics, deep-learning, and multi-modal integration and will describe how this approach will allow for real-time monitoring of AI models in medical imaging without the need for ground truth data.
